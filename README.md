**Stackwatch** is a lightweight profiler for PHP 8.1+.  It helps you measure performance with precisionâ€”without
unnecessary complexity. 

**Stackwatch**  bridges the gap between basic timers and heavy profiling tools like [PHPBench](https://phpbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) or [Blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/).
It is perfect for:

- Isolated performance testing
- Annotated profiling of large codebases
- Lightweight integration into dev workflows

> Zero-dependency core. Optional CLI with familiar Symfony Console integration.

## Installation

~~~
composer require bakame/stackwatch

- **PHP >= 8.1** but the latest stable version of PHP is recommended
